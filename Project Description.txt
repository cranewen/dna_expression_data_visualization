The project is written in Python and R.
Python handles parsing data from spreadsheets raw data.
R Shiny handles visualization functions.
In Python part, there are two folders. Module includes database functions.
FileTools includes data processing functions.
In R part, there are two folders, which are Visualization Tool and Shiny Gene Tool.
They are two different apps.
Since I can't disclose the data I have been working on, so I made up the dataset.
Under B_DNA data folder, each folder represents a single experiment. I made two
folders to simulate the original data. The names of the folders are the
format of the original dataset. Parsing those strings to design
and create a MySQL database was a big part of this project.
